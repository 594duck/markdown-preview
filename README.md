# Chrome Markdown Extension

Automatically parses markdown files (.md) into HTML. This is useful
if you're writing markdown (ultimately targeting HTML) and want a quick
preview.


# Usage

1. Install extension from [webstore][] (creates no new UI)
2. Open .md file in Chrome.
3. See nicely formatted HTML.
